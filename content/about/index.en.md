Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m from Taiwan, currently a master student of Robotics at UIUC, focusing on Computer Vision & Machine learning. I have three years working experience in the field of AOI(Automatic Optical Inspection). 

<br>

Inspired by [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), recently I have been working on an online book titled [Simple Explanation of 3D Reconstruction Concepts](https://hackmd.io/@jackyyeh/BJxMZtUUT/%2FUlgB_NcwRxm01ZMi2NY3Fg). Reinforcing my professional skills by teaching others, fantastic!

<br>

Outside of computer science, I am into hand brew coffee, with [Tetsu Kasuya](https://www.instagram.com/tetsukasuya/?hl=en) as my role idol. Also a study group launcher, enjoy discussing various [interesting topics](https://hackmd.io/ay_01KmxQbqfmESrkUN6ug?view) every week with my lovely group members. â˜•ðŸ“š

Feel free to send me any messages or questions (jackyyeh511@gmail.com). I would be glad to respond or have conversation with you.
