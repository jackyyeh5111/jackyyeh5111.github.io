    <description><![CDATA[Github Repository This project is built with OpenCV, YOLOv3 and some Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in real-time video streams.1. Key Features Train YOLO with custom dataset. Enabling face mask detection in real-time video streams using Streamlit. 2. MotivationIn the midst of the persistent COVID-19 pandemic, the need for effective face mask detection applications has surged. However, the scarcity of substantial datasets containing images depicting individuals wearing masks has presented a significant obstacle, intensifying the complexity and difficulty of this undertaking.]]></description>
